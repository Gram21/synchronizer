# synchronizer
A little tool to synchronize two folders. This is majorly a little side-project to play around with JavaFX etc.
There are still many open TODO's:
- Make this more beautiful
- Tweak performance and parallelize parts of the code
- Overhaul ugly parts of the code, tidy up and maybe better MVC
